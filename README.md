# Trust-Region-Dogleg-Method-for-Rosenbrock-Function:

This project implements the Trust Region Dogleg method to optimize the Rosenbrock function, a well-known test problem for optimization algorithms. The Rosenbrock function is actually often used to evaluate the performance of optimization methods due to its non-convex nature and challenging landscape.
